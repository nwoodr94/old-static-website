    <h2>Clean Code</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        I write clean code for my company. I like the idea of not just being a principled developer, but also writing
        principled code. I have solved problems for my company by following advice in this book.
        <br />
        <br />
        Clean Code is famous among software developers, because it very well constitutes the source of truth when we
        strive to develop good software. Everything from writing good comments, to elegant functions, and neat
        architecture is important, and I cite these books frequently.

    <h2>DevOps</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        DevOps is a union of developement and operations teams designed to reduce cycle time in software development.
        It's not just a strategy, but a culture, and companies with a proper DevOps implementation are not only really
        fun to work for, but they make a ton of money.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have experience with CI/CD processes, and I make use of cloud-based technology everyday.

    <h2>Agile</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        I fully endorse the agile methodology, because it produces results. I have only had positive experiences with
        Agile teams and I'm always proud to sign off on software developed under such conditions.
