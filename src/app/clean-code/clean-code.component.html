    <h2>Clean Code</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        I really enjoy the Clean Code series' statements on neat design, developer ethics, time management, and workplace and life skills. I have solved problems for my company by following advice in these books. He's funny too.

        Clean Code is famous among established software developers, because it very well
        constitutes a source of truth when we strive to develop good software. Everything from writing good comments to elegant functions and neat architecture is important, and I cite these books frequently.

    <h2>DevOps</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        DevOps is a union of developement and operations teams designed to reduce cycle time in software development. It's not just a strategy, but a culture, and companies with a proper DevOps implementation are not only really fun to work for, but they make a ton of money.

        I have experience with CI/CD processes, and I make use of cloud-based technology everyday.

    <h2>Agile</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        I'm the wrong demographic to be posting manifestos on the internet, so I'm thankful someone else was able to do it for me. 

        <br />
        <br />

        I fully endorse the agile methodology, because it produces results. I have only had positive experiences with Agile teams and I'm always proud to sign off on software developed under such conditions.
