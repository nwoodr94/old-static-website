    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm native to the Pacific Northwest, and I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied Physics in 2017. I performed an academic emphasis in mathemetics, but most of my research efforts involved the space sciences.
      <br />
      <br />
      The day I graduated, I packed my car full of everything I owned and drove to Austin, TX.

    <h2>My Programming Story</h2>
    <p>
      I first learned to code with a space science laboratory at the University of Washington, where I was challenged to design and build sounding rockets. I also engineered payloads, designed to explore the kinematics of flight, acquire state properties of the atmosphere, and transmit GPS telemetry.
      <br />
      <br />
      To develop these payloads, I programmed an Arduino to communicate with a variety of commercially available sensors and instrumentation.
      <br />
      <br />
      My first programming language was C.
      <br />
      <br />
      I totally geeked out, even sometimes skipping class to work on my rocket. You can view my code <u>here</u>.
      <br />
      <br />
      As an established developer, I intend to fund my own research into more advanced propulsion technologies, such as a hybrid configuration, and of course build on my experience with embedded systems.

    <h2>Machine Preferences</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently developing on a Microsoft Surfacebook. I enjoy a modern layout and the i5/8Gig machine specs are standard for most developers.
      <br />
      <br />
      A future project of mine is to build my own PC, and configure a remote shell to utilize its hardware for more resource intensive work.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>
      I genuinely enjoy what I do for work, and so it's possible the line between work and play blur at times.  However, if you've ever met anyone from the Pacific Northwest, you'd rightly figure I have hobbies in the outdoors, and naturally great taste in outerwear. Dangerously remote locations are my zen.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm enthusiastic about fitness, and I regularly train with a local crossfit gym.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sci-Fi is my jam. You can check out my reviews for sci-fi movies and shows <u>here</u>.
      <br />
      <br />
      I enjoy cooking, finance, podcasts, and daydreaming about buying a Model X.
