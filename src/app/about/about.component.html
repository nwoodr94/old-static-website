    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p>
        I'm native to the Pacific Northwest, and I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied
        Physics in 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the summer of 2019 I completed a software development bootcamp, and due to my interest in working with data,
        I started work as a Data Engineer in Los Angeles.
        <br />
        <br />

      <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy fitness, investing, cooking, cnc machines, and space science. You can find me anywhere the sun is
        shining. A goal of mine is to save up for a Toyota 4Runner.
        <br />

      <h2>My Programming Story</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I first learned to code with a space science laboratory at the University of Washington, where I was challenged
        to
        design and build sounding rockets. These rockets carry payloads to explore the kinematics of flight,
        acquire state properties of the atmosphere, and transmit GPS telemetry.
        <br />
        <br />
        To develop these payloads, I programmed an Arduino to communicate with commercially available sensors
        and instrumentation.
        <br />
        <br />
        My first programming language was C.
        <br />
        <br />
        I totally geeked out, even sometimes skipping class to work on my rocket. You can view the source code
