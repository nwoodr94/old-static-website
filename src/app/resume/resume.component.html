        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            I'm a Software Developer with Southern California Edison in Los Angeles. SCE provides electricity to 14
            million residents in the Southern California region.
            <br />
            <br />
            I work on an internal facing data team, building and maintaining infrastructure related to an operational data store. I build ETL pipelines, script in PL/SQL and Python, aggregate statistics in Oracle, and build data layer application modules. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Because I was trained as a full-stack developer, I supplement the data engineering I do at work by building full-stack websites in Angular/Node, and deploying them on AWS.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a practicioner of agile and waterfall lifecycle methodologies, DevOps utilities like Git and SonarCloud, and clean code.
